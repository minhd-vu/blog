## The Flight and an Unexpected Friendship

My journey from Washington D.C. to Bali began with a long flight, with a layover in Doha, Qatar. As luck would have it, I found myself seated next to a college student around my age. Our seats were at the very back of the plane, where there are only two seats per row instead of the usual three in economy class.

During the flight, I asked the flight attendant for some of the banana-shaped rice cracker snacks, and she kindly gave me two. Noticing that my seatmate had slept through the first meal service, I offered him one. He accepted it with a friendly smile and later returned the gesture. This small act of sharing sparked a conversation that made the long flight much more enjoyable.

He was a student at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), heading home to Kuwait for the summer to visit his family. We chatted about his hobbiesâ€”bodybuilding and playing Call of Duty. He even shared some impressive COD highlights saved on his phone.

One thing that stood out to me was how he referred to Kuwait as "my country." He spoke with pride, saying things like, "My country has the best food," or "My country has a lot of bodybuilders." It made me reflect on my own sense of belonging and identity.

## Reflecting on Identity

As a Vietnamese-American, I've never felt compelled to refer to either the United States or Vietnam as "my country." I feel a strong connection to both places, and to choose one over the other feels like undermining a part of who I am. If someone asked me if I was proud to be American, I might say yes, but my pride in my Vietnamese heritage feels stronger. However, my Vietnamese identity comes with its own set of complexities.

Sometimes, I experience a sense of imposter syndrome when identifying as Vietnamese. Although my Vietnamese language skills are better than most Vietnamese-Americans I know, I still struggle to express emotions and feelings in Vietnamese. Most of my language use revolves around practical, everyday tasks.

The question "Where are you from?" also brings up interesting nuances. Domestically, people are often asking about my cultural background or ethnicity. Internationally, the question becomes more complex. My go-to response is, "I'm from the United States, but I was born in Vietnam." If I hadn't been born overseas, this question might be harder to answer.

Interestingly, people often have trouble guessing my ethnicity. On one occasion, a Chinese person asked if I was Chinese. When I said no, he commented, "Oh, you look Chinese." I scrutinize my own face more than anyone else, but I can't pinpoint any distinctly Vietnamese features. There are certain physical traits that are stereotypically associated with other Asian ethnicities, but I feel like I lack those for Vietnamese people. Sometimes, I joke to myself about being switched at birth.

In my tennis group, a Korean member once asked if I was Korean. When I said no, he remarked, "You could pass as Korean and no one would know." Similarly, on my flight home from Bali with Korean Air, passengers and crew members often spoke to me in Korean, and I had to ask them to repeat in English. Occasionally, I wish I looked more Vietnamese to avoid this confusion.
