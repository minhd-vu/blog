I'm a pretty minimalist and lazy person when it comes to carrying things. I try to limit it to things that I absolutely need. Let's start with the basics: my wallet, keys, and phone.

For my wallet, I use a Big Skinny nylon bifold for my wallet because it's a very slim wallet. I made this switch recently. Before this, I had a leather bifold that was a little bulkier. I had that for as long as I can remember. I try to keep it as light as possible, only really at most keeping two credit cards, insurance information, IDs, and some cash. I considered switching to something more minimalistic like a card holder, but since I always carry cash, I didn't think it would be feasible. I also carry my wallet in my front pocket, where a thicker wallet may be more visible.

For my keys, I only keep my car key fob on the lower half portion of a sentimental lanyard. I have my gym key fob on it too, but this will likely be removed once my membership expires. Honestly, I rarely go to the gym, I'd rather play a sport for exercise.

For my phone, I just switched to the iPhone 15. I used to have the iPhone 11 for the past couple of years. I switched because I was waiting for an iPhone with USB-C and my phone storage was getting dangerously close to the 64GB limit. The only things I do on my phone are iMessage, FaceTime, and browse TikTok, so I don't require the latest-gen processor or camera module. Usually, if I care about the photos I'm taking, I'll take my DSLR with me.

Usually, I'll keep these things in my pocket, but if I plan on walking around I'll place them in a drawstring bag. I bought one from Amazon a couple of years ago, and I like how comfortable and convenient it is. There's a zipper on the front which is nice for organizing different things. I'll also throw my multi-tool into the drawstring sometimes depending on where I'm going.

The GOAT multi-tool is one of my favorite pieces in my EDC, it's like the central piece to it all, and I think it works really well for me. The first tool that I had that played a similar role I used was a basic Kershaw liner lock blade that my brother had lying around. I used it a lot at home for opening boxes and stuff. Once I started commuting and traveling for work, I would bring it and it would help open things and accomplish random tasks. I also brought it when I would visit my friends, and it proved useful on multiple occasions.

Later, I wanted to use a multi-tool rather than just a knife, so I grabbed a SOG PowerPint and it worked pretty well for its form factor. I mostly used it as an all-in-one solution and stopped carrying my blade. The Kershaw I had was made of all metal so sometimes when it was in my pocket my shorts would sag down a bit. I wanted a PowerPint because there were instances where I wish I had pliers, but didn't have any on hand. One time when visiting a friend, I needed to take off some strong adhesive hooks, and I couldn't have done it without the PowerPint. The one caveat I had with the PowerPint was that, because of the form factor, the blade was pretty small, and therefore wasn't very versatile. Next, I purchased the TiRant Razor v3. It was light, and I enjoyed carrying it for that very reason. I carried both the PowerPint and the Razor for some time, but ultimately it ended up being more than I wanted to have. I wanted to condense it.

During this time I was a backer of the GOAT multi-tool on Indiegogo, and once I finally received it, I instantly fell in love with the tool. Because it's modular, the implements can be swapped around for an ideal configuration. I immediately started fiddling with it and making improvements to the tool to better fit my needs. I immediately swapped out the default blade for the 35VN one and because it also includes a hobby blade, it was perfect for both tasks that required a larger edge or more precision. I moved the blade over to be left-hand openable, removed the pocket clip, and reordered some of the middle implements. I also added some shims between the implements to decrease the clumping that happens when opening one tool. Overall, I enjoy using the GOAT multi-tool, and I think I have it in a configuration that perfectly fits my needs. The only issue I have is sometimes it can be hard to get enough leverage to open the blade. I designed a thumb stud of sorts with CAD, but I haven't gotten the chance to print it because my 3D printer is broken.

My EDC also consists of my backpack. Usually, if I'm not carrying things in just my pockets or a drawstring, then I'll take my entire backpack. My backpack was a gift from my mom in my sophomore year of high school. It's a North Face Surge, and it's still going strong after all these years. My philosophy on tools that I use is that the only reason you should upgrade is if you're missing a significant amount of functionality. I think it's more resourceful, and it's fun coming up with creative solutions to some shortcomings in products. I'll give you a tour of what goes inside my backpack, and then I'll show you some modifications I made for it to better fit my needs.

I think the only reason I would upgrade this backpack is for a camera backpack that has a hard shell on the inside to protect the lenses and body. Right now, I have a separate camera backpack, but consolidating it into one thing would be a nice change.

If I'm carrying my backpack, I almost always have a least one laptop in it. If I'm traveling to a place where I'll need to work then I'll travel with both my personal and work laptop. I also always keep a charger in my backpack that is shared across the two laptops, and I don't take it out. At home, I use a dock so I don't need to take my charger out of my backpack. I used to keep an aluminum water bottle and umbrella, but I found that in the places where I frequent, I rarely need those two things. Those items were more important when I was still in school. I also usually throw my AirPods and multi-tool inside my backpack as well. I also have a USB-C hub, and I use this pretty frequently when I'm not at home. I also have one engraved pen with my name that my brother gifted to me, and an alpha-gel mechanical pencil. Honestly, I rarely write anything anymore, so I keep the pen for when I need to sign a document, and the pencil has been untouched since I was in school. I usually type everything these days. Also, I keep a deck of cards, a collection of sticky notes, some flash drives, and a lock. Some other essentials I sometimes put in my back is a quart-sized bag with my toothbrush and razor. I also keep some lip balm, deodorant, and lotion in my bag. I never really used lotion, so I'm thinking of replacing that with a sunscreen and moisturizer combo. There is also a compartment in my backpack where I keep my tech accessories. It contains some USB cables and adapters. This pretty much completes what I have in my backpack. I take this backpack everywhere when I'm traveling, and I don't find that I'm missing anything when I go on these trips.

I hope you found it interesting what I carry around, and who knows? Maybe you'll take some inspiration from me to change up your EDC!
