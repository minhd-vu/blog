I don't usually buy many things for myself, but when I do I try to make them worthwhile purchases that are of a high quality. I generally gravitate towards buy-it-for-life products, and I'd like to share with you a couple of my favorite purchases from 2023.

Grabbing the Logitech MX Vertical mouse was a game-changer for ergonomics. Originally, I would use my high-tent split keyboard with the Apple Magic Trackpad, but I noticed that I started to get some strain on my wrist. I switched over to the MX Vertical, and after a couple of days of getting used to it, it was significantly more comfortable. I think it's because I don't need to rotate my wrist to use the mouse, I can kind of just keep my hand at the same angle when moving from my keyboard to my mouse. I like the multi-device Bluetooth capabilities, and I use it to switch between my personal and work laptops. When I game, I still switch back to a traditional "horizontal" mouse since I can make finer movements.

My mom gifted me an iPhone 15 for my birthday, so I grabbed a MagSafe compatible case and car charger. In my opinion, it has made a world of difference. I used to have a phone car mount that would clamp to my phone, and since my car requires me to use an AUX cable for audio, I could never charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. It would also get loose and require readjustment from time to time. This MagSafe Car Charger solves all of the problems above and has improved my quality of life.

I was gifted a Brooks Brothers' Luxury Collection dress shirt a while back, and I loved it. It was so soft, and I felt that the fit was so flattering on me. The only problem was that I only had one of them. I purchased a couple more for myself during the holiday season, and I am very much looking forward to wearing them out. In addition, I also purchased some high-waisted wool dress trousers from Spier & Mackay. These are very roomy and comfortable--I could possibly run in them, but the material drapes very well so it looks very fitted. I've pretty much worked as a remote software engineer my whole life, so the things I wear to work are the same clothes I sleep in--a T-shirt and shorts. Whenever I go outside, it's usually an occasion, so I make an effort to dress well and stand out. It gives me confidence and a warm feeling inside.

![2L Glass Water Bottle](/assets/blog/favorite-purchases-of-2023/water-bottle.jpeg)

Although this was a purchase I made in 2022, it may be the greatest purchase I have made in my life so far. Getting a large glass water bottle was the most convenient thing for a lazy software engineer. I refill it once a day in the morning and it lasts me throughout the entire day. With other water bottles, I would have to refill multiple times a day, and I was too lazy to even refill it since it took so many trips. Eventually, it got to a point where I would only ever refill if I was dying of thirst. Since it's glass and I only ever put water in it, it doesn't get dirty as quickly as traditional water bottles, and the water tastes really good even if it's been in the bottle for a couple of days. I recently broke the one I bought in 2022, so I just ordered another one. Hopefully, this one doesn't shatter since it has a silicone cover that protects more of its surface area, but I think I'll keep buying more even in the event of them breaking.

That's it for my favorite purchases of 2023! I hope you enjoyed hearing about how these items made my list, and maybe you'll pick up some items of a similar nature.
