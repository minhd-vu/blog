Hey! Welcome to the first installment of my blog! I want to share a special topic for my first post, so I will be covering my keyboard journey in its entirety. Re-experience with me the first keyboard I ever received and understand the decisions I made which led to my current endgame today.

The first keyboard I ever received was from my brother as a birthday present around elementary or middle school. I remember being ecstatic when I opened my gift, unveiling a new Razer BlackWidow V1. This was the first _gaming_ keyboard I ever got, and it instantly replaced what was on my desk for several years. Around the time I started college, my desk was moved from the living room to my bedroom due to some renovations. The BlackWidow had clicky switches, so it made a little more noise than desired--especially at night when I would be in closer proximity to my sleeping family members. As a result, I switched to one of the keyboards my brother used which was a simple $40 mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches.

Up until this point, I usually would only use these keyboards for gaming. Most of the work I did was on a laptop, and I would use the integrated laptop keyboard for most things productivity-related. In Summer 2022, I interned at Coinbase where they generously provided me with a $500 stipend to be used for work-from-home equipment. I realized that this would be a great opportunity to curate my work-from-home setup as I would be transitioning into full-time work after the summer. The first keyboard I ever bought was the Keychron K8 which served me well throughout my internship and was a pleasure to use! But, like anyone who has ventured into the craft, it's hard to turn back after one keyboard.

During my internship, my mentor at Coinbase and I would have brief talks about keyboards. These were what sparked me to jump down into the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards. I started binging YouTube videos on the topic, eventually concluding that I cared most about ergonomics and the feel of the keyboard. Toward the end of the internship, I ordered a pre-built Iris Rev. 6 with Gatteron Milky Yellow switches, FR4 plates, and a frosted acrylic middle layer. In hindsight, I should've ordered it unassembled, but I was a little scared to mess up the build. I completely switched from VSCode to Neovim and so did my keyboard. It took around a week of continuous practice on typing websites to get used to the layout, but after I did, it was a delightful experience, and my WPM improved from 80 to 100.

Later, with the help of my brother, I made some 80&deg; tents for the keyboard out of an oak wood slab from Home Depot. Although I had a 3D printer, I wasn't familiar with CAD, so I instead chose to make it out of wood. The keyboard was mounted to the wood with some screws and wooden dowels. The oak also came with the benefit of being heavy enough to not tip over when typing, nor would it slide around on my desk when force was applied. The Iris' middle layer had tenting holes cut out so I used those to fix the keyboard to the wooden blocks.

Since this keyboard has fewer keys than a traditional keyboard, I had to use different layers to map multiple keys. It was an unfamiliar experience at first, but once I got used to it, I never really need to look at the keys anymore. [Here's my layout](https://github.com/minhd-vu/minhd-vu/blob/main/keyboards/iris_rev__6b.json) if you'd like to try it out for yourself. There's nothing too special about it except that I use one-shot modifiers and layers. This allows for a rolling motion rather than holding multiple keys down at once.

I continued my voyage down the rabbit hole, and there was but one feature I hadn't tried--concavity. Although I had no soldering experience, I took it upon myself to try to build a [Charybdis](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/). It was fairly challenging, and I was pretty scared of frying the board but with some luck, I completed the build without messing up anything too badly. I tried using the Charybdis for about a week. I did like the concavity, but when compared to the Iris, I found my fingers moving further than needed since the switches had spacing between them. In the end, I decided to switch back to the Iris with the wooden tents.

I was pretty content with this setup until [Keebio](https://keeb.io/) released the aluminum case for the Iris. I grabbed this case along with an Iris Rev. 5 PCB. I also purchased some [Matias Click Switches](https://matias.ca/switches/click/) and [Matias Blank White Alps Keycaps](https://matias.store/products/keycap-set-white-blank-preonic) for the build. I had gotten the chance to try out some SKCM Blue Alps, and I wanted to replicate the feel with this new build. I had a lot of trouble with the build mostly because of the switch plate of the aluminum case not being compatible with Alps switches. This required me to go through the process of using a diamond file to enlarge the USB holes. I also had a problem of the board shorting itself, so I tried a multitude of solutions: painter's tape, electrical tape, liquid electrical tape, etc. The solution that ultimately fixed the shorting issue was placing a 2mm cutout of EVA foam between the PCB and the bottom of the case. Since then, I haven't had any more shortages. I also printed some tents for this as the wooden ones from before were no longer compatible. You can find the mounts used in the cover [_here_](https://github.com/minhd-vu/cad/blob/master/keyboard/tenting/iris/iris_aluminum_case_tent.stl) and an updated one-piece mount that provides more stability [here](https://github.com/minhd-vu/cad/blob/master/keyboard/tenting/iris/iris_ae_one-piece_tent.stl).

Although I work completely remotely, there are times and wants/needs to travel whether it be to visit friends, family, or an off-site with coworkers. Taking this into consideration, I built another Iris, this time a blackout version with the [Matias Quiet Click Switches](http://matias.ca/switches/quiet/) instead. These switches aren't nearly as tactile, but they do make the keyboard much quieter. Since this was my third Iris build, I became well acquainted with the process and finished the project in one evening.

This concludes my keyboard journey for now. However, I still have an itch for concavity, so there may be another keyboard-related post soon!
