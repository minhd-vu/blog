This past September, I took a trip to Morocco with a group of friends — a trip that one of my friends planned, and honestly, it turned out to be one of the most intense and adventure-packed weeks I’ve ever had. We were in a different city every night, constantly on the move, constantly discovering something new. It was exhausting in the best possible way.

## Getting There: Boston → Madrid → Marrakech

Because flights were cheapest out of Boston, a few of us took a train up and met another friend who already lived there. We spent a night in Boston and flew out early the next morning, connecting through Madrid before finally landing in Morocco on Wednesday, September 10th.

From the airport, we picked up our rental car — the beginning of what would be many hours of road time.

## First Impressions: Tizi n’Tichka Pass

Our first destination was Tizi n’Tichka, a mountain pass with sweeping views that immediately made the long travel worth it. The road wound through dramatic landscapes, with towering mountains surrounding us on all sides. It was our first real look at Morocco, and it set the tone for the whole trip.

We stayed the night at Auberge Ayous, where we had dinner and crashed early. The next morning, we enjoyed breakfast before driving straight toward the desert.

## Sahara Desert Safari

The desert safari ended up being one of the absolute highlights.

We rode camels into the dunes — something I’d done before in Dubai, but the Dubai ride felt like a small loop compared to this. In Morocco, we rode deeper into the landscape with real scenery, real dunes, and real silence.

We watched the sunset, had dinner under the stars, listened to traditional Berber music around a campfire, and even got some sandboarding in. Late at night, I looked up and saw my first-ever shooting star, something I’ll never forget.

The next morning, I nearly slept through sunrise, but my friend shook me awake just in time. After breakfast, we took ATVs out of camp — and that ride was wild. We climbed the highest dunes, looked out across the Sahara, and even caught a glimpse of the border with Algeria.

## Todra Gorge & Dades Gorge

We continued our road trip by driving to Todra Gorge, followed by Dades Gorge. Both spots felt like scenes from another planet — narrow passageways carved by rivers, towering rock cliffs, winding roads.

After returning the rental car, we headed toward Marrakech.

## Marrakech: Beauty & Chaos

Our first night in Marrakech was a bit rough. We had some overly aggressive “guides” approach us in the Medina — not exactly a scam, but definitely uncomfortable. I’ve dealt with this type of thing before, so it didn’t bother me too much, but some of my friends were stressed since it was their first encounter with anything like that.

Still, Marrakech itself was beautiful: busy, colorful, loud, and full of life.

## Train to Fez

From Marrakech, we took the train to Fez, arriving at the famous Blue Gate. We wandered through the Medina and soaked in the maze-like streets before taking a bus to Chefchaouen the next day.

## Chefchaouen: The Blue City

Chefchaouen was absolutely worth the detour. We explored the Medina and hiked up to the Spanish Mosque to watch the sunset — a long, slow, beautiful one that painted the whole blue city in warm colors. It was one of the most peaceful moments of the trip.

Afterward, we bused back to Fez.

## Free Time in Fez

We spent one more night in Fez, and during the day I got a few hours to myself. Honestly, this was one of my favorite parts of the whole trip.

I wandered around, shopped, talked to locals, and just absorbed the atmosphere. I had long conversations with a few shopkeepers, and moments like that really remind me why I love traveling — the spontaneity, the cultural exchanges, the human connections. Even though we had a packed itinerary, this little pocket of free time meant a lot.

## Back to Marrakech and Home

After one last night in Marrakech, we packed up and headed to the airport. All of us — including my friend who lives in Boston — flew back together on the same long-haul return flight.

But the journey wasn’t quite over yet. When we landed back in the U.S., we had one more leg to get to DC, while our Boston friend peeled off in Boston. So we all started the trip together, and we all ended the main flight together — just with slightly different end destinations.

## Final Thoughts

Morocco was fast, intense, and full of movement — a different city every night, constant transitions, endless views. But it was also one of the most memorable trips I’ve taken. From camel rides in the Sahara to conversations in Fez, the trip had a perfect mix of adventure, culture, and quiet moments.

If I ever go back, I’d love to slow down and spend more time in fewer places… but honestly, I’m grateful for how much we saw. It was one of those trips that stays with you long after you get home.
