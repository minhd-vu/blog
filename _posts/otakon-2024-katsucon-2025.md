## Otakon

Otakon was my first-ever anime convention, and I was really excited to go. I only started watching anime around the COVID era because one of my good friends introduced me to it. Before that, I didn’t enjoy watching media with subtitles. It didn’t feel as immersive, but I quickly became a fan and got totally hooked on the stories and visuals.

I cosplayed as Aki from _Chainsaw Man_ since I had long hair at the time. This was my first cosplay, so I chose something relatively simple. A lot of people were actually pretty impressed with how I got my hair to stick up! I used a chopstick and some hair ties to keep it in place. Honestly, I think it was a pretty clever solution. I had a lot of fun when people stopped to take photos with me. I think they were more interested in the hair than the cosplay though.

I donated my hair a couple of weeks after the convention. Honestly, I only kept it that long for the cosplay. I wanted my first cosplay to feel memorable, and I definitely made that happen.

I met a couple of people who said, "Hi." Most of them were locals, but I did meet a couple from New York. Hopefully, I’ll run into some of them again. I like grabbing their Instagrams and watching how they progress in life.

My most memorable moments at Otakon were the maid café, the AMV contest, the rave, and of course, shopping. The maid café was fun—we got loot bags, and mine included a maid card pack. I pulled a silver Maid Ruka card, which was pretty rare. All my friends and one of the butlers hyped me up. Only the gold version was rarer.

The AMV contest gave us two straight hours of peak AMVs. I loved watching them, voting, and getting inspired by the editors. I’ve always enjoyed watching edits—mostly video game ones—but after the show, I felt super motivated to try editing an AMV myself. I’m currently working on one to submit to the Otakon 2025 AMV Contest.

My friends and I only stayed at the rave for a short time, mostly because we had trouble finding it. We checked out a bunch of other events too, and some overlapped with the rave. The short time I spent there was still a blast—someone even complimented my hair, even though it was down, which was a first. On the train afterward, we met someone who had stayed longer. My eyes widened when he told us he convinced two girls to throw it back on a guy in a wheelchair.

I loved chatting with strangers. It’s way easier to start conversations when you know they’re the same kind of weird as you (no offense).

## Katsucon

My friends and I ran it back for round two at Katsucon! Some of the highlights included the AMVs, shopping, the rave, and the 18+ panels.

This year, I went as Okarun from _Dandadan_! I wish I’d gotten the wig in time, but I couldn’t, so I threw together a bit of a makeshift cosplay. Someone finally recognized me toward the end of the convention, which totally made my day.

Katsucon featured a bunch of AMV showings—each targeted at different age groups—but none of the AMVs repeated. We went to the 13+ and the 18+ ones. I had a great time watching and took some mental notes for inspiration. The ecchi category in the 18+ showing? Total jumpscare. My retinas were not ready.

I had a blast shopping at both conventions. Otakon had a bigger selection, but that makes sense since it’s a larger con. There was still plenty to explore—and probably a lot I missed at both. I usually collect posters and hang them in my room. Right now, my walls and doors are covered in them. It’s comforting to walk into my room and see a bunch of art I love. Shopping feels like visiting a museum—walking around, admiring art, chatting with artists about their work, and buying something when I fall in love with it.

We stayed at the rave longer this time since fewer events overlapped. A few different artists performed, but I enjoyed the music and dancing with my friends. I don’t get to dance often, so it’s always a treat.

The 18+ panels were ridiculously funny. One of them was _Smash or Pass: Hoe-ror Edition_. They showed slides of characters from horror games, and the audience yelled out “Smash” or “Pass.” Some slides were hilarious (like power tools), and there was a whole lot of audience barking. The other panel we went to was a speed dating game. Gyaru panelists picked audience members who tried to rizz them up. It felt like a dating game show, with questions like, “Where would you take me on a first date?” The contestants came up with some wild, funny, and super awkward responses.

That pretty much wraps up my experience at these conventions. I plan to go every year from now on—I had such a blast. The next one on my list is Otakon 2025—so maybe I’ll catch you there!
