## Otakon

Otakon was my first-ever anime convention, and I was really excited to attend. I only really started watching anime around the COVID era because one of my good friends introduced me to it. Before that, I didn’t enjoy watching media that required subtitles—it didn’t feel as immersive. But I quickly became a fan and got totally hooked on the stories and visuals.

I cosplayed as Aki from Chainsaw Man since I had long hair at the time. This was my first cosplay, so I wanted to go with something relatively easy. A lot of people were actually pretty impressed with how I got my hair to stick up! I used a chopstick and some hair ties to keep it in place—honestly, I think it was a pretty clever solution. It was really fun having people stop to take photos with me, too.
